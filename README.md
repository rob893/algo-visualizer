# algo-visualizer

See application here: https://rob893.github.io/algo-visualizer

This application visualizes various pathfinding algorithms.
This stands out from the many other pathfinding visualizers out there in that all of the pathfinding logic is written in Rust and compiled to web assembly to be ran at runtime.
